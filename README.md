Budgeter, an app idea for tracking costs and incomes on a per-user basis using Flask and an SQLAlchemy connection to a database.

## Getting started
First, fork this repo, set your fork to remote origin, and set this repo to upstream: `git remote add upstream https://github.com/dcl67/budgeter.git`

Create a venv on your local machine: `python3 -m venv venv`.

To install the dependencies for this app, run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` (Note that, as of this commit, requirements.txt does not yet exist.)

To pull remote changes from upstream, use `git pull upstream <branch> --rebase`. Pull requests with merge commits will not be accepted.

When commiting, your commit messages should seek to complete the following sentence: "This commit will..." e.g. "Add the '/home' route".
